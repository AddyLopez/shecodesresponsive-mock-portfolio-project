## Description

Student project for SheCodes Responsive coding workshop.

**_Learning objective_**: To prototype a responsive mock-portfolio website with placeholder data based on the demo provided. This project simulates the teamwork and division of labor involved in a professional collaboration between a UX/UI designer and me as the developer. At the same time, it showcases the self-directedness that comes with greater experience and competence in HTML, CSS, and a professional development workflow.

## Features

#### Accessibility, Design, & Workflow Considerations

- Includes demo's media assets as placeholder images and reproduces the given design, thereby simulating a professional collaboration with a UX/UI designer

- Skilled use of Google Chrome's DevTools for debugging and prototyping changes in the browser. The toggle device tools were especially useful for testing the responsiveness of my code on devices of different sizes.

- Coded in VS Code using professional development workflow tools such as Live Server and GitHub Desktop, with hosting on Netlify, implementing a process of continuous deployment

- Includes this polished README, written using Markdown
